# Data #

Data files are not included in this repository. You need to provide the original Hi-C data yourself to run this script.
Hi-C datasets can be easily downloaded from the public databases; for example, we obtained ours from [Rao et al, (2014) on GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE63525).
Alternatively, you can input your own Hi-C data matrix.

The correlation matrix that results from pre-processing (as in `demo1_prepCorr_HiC`) can also be saved in this folder, to be used as the input for Multi-CD (`demo2_MultiCD`).
